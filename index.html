		        	<p>Hi, welcome to my website. My name is Hossein (Bryan) Bakhtiyari. I am father of two beautiful and intelligent daughters and husband to an amazing woman. I have been living in Charlotte for the last 26 years and love this area. Go Panthers!</p><br>
		        	<p>My Background: I am an Electronics Engineer. During the time I was employed in a regional manufacturing company, and later on when I was working as a freelancer, my area of focus has been design and development of microprocessor and microcontroller based systems. As a part of the process of development, I have been writing the software for these systems in different Assembly Languages depending on which microprocessor family was used. During the last couple of years, in order to expand my knowledge of programming, I have been taking courses in Object Oriented Programming languages such as Java and C# as well as some other courses related to the field of Information Technology.</p><br>
		        	<p>I have an entrepreneurial mindset, so nine years ago I took the required real estate courses and passed the exams and received the Real Estate Broker License. Since then, I have been mostly advising real estate investment companies and individuals. As a part of the process of marketing the real estate properties, I had to learn and use some elements of the Adobe CS Suit including Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I found this recently gained knowledge to be very interesting and enjoyed applying it towards the graphic designs of my marketing brochures.</p><br>
		        	<p>Why Full Stack Web Development? When I decided to change my career path, the first thought was “What is the field in which I can combine both my experience of programming and my other interests into a dream career.” The choice was obvious. I am currently participating in the Coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte to develop the necessary skills needed to be part of this career track.</p><br>
		        	<p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
